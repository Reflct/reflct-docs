# Welcome to the Reflct Beta!

Thank you for joining us! Reflct is here to help you showcase 3D Gaussian splat scenes, making it straightforward to create, manage, and publish to the web.

## Getting Started

This walkthrough will introduce you to the platform's main features and show you how to:

- Upload and compress your .ply files.
- Manage and set up views in your 3DGS scenes.
- Publish your scenes with controlled navigation limits.
 
 

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0, overflow: 'hidden', maxWidth: '100%', width: '100%', marginTop: '2rem', borderRadius: '10px', boxShadow: '0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)' }}>
  <iframe 
    style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%', borderRadius: '10px' }}
