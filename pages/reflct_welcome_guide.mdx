# Getting Started with Reflct

## 1. Create Your First Scene

- Log in to Reflct
- On the dashboard, click **New Scene**
- Give your scene a name and tags
- Drag and drop your `.ply` or SOGs bundle into the uploader

### Optimization

If you upload a `.ply`, you can choose to optimise the file. This converts it to a compressed `.ply` format, which is highly optimized at roughly 5-7x smaller than the original `.ply`. The process significantly reduces file size while preserving high visual quality. SOGs provides even greater compression at up to 20x, check our [guide on how to convert to SOGs](/Convert_to_SOGs).

## 2. Adjust the Scene Orientation

After your scene loads, it's likely that you'll need to adjust the orientation:

- Click **Edit Scene** in the top left
- Enable the grid to see the horizon
- Use the gizmos to rotate and align your scene correctly

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '42%', height: 0, overflow: 'hidden', maxWidth: '80%', width: '80%', margin: '2rem auto', borderRadius: '10px', boxShadow: '0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)' }}>
  <video 
    style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%', borderRadius: '10px' }}
    controls
    muted
    playsInline
  >
    <source src="/edit-scene-rotation.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
</div>

**Tip:** Most scenes will need a small rotation fix to align to the horizon.

## 3. Navigate the Scene

- **WASD** – Move through the scene
- **Left-click** – Set orbit focus point
- **Left-click and drag** - Orbit
- **Right-click and drag** – Pan
- **Scroll** – Dolly in/out
- **Ctrl+Scroll** - Zoom

## 4. Set Up Views

Views let you define camera angles and control how users explore your scene.

- Navigate around the scene untl you find a viewpoint you like
- Go to the **Views** panel on the left of the screen
- Create a **View Group**, then create a **View** - this will be the first view a user sees, you can edit and reorder views later.
- Create as many views as you like, there is no limit.

### Setting Orbit Limits

Orbit limits are a key feature of Reflct, and ensure that your users only see what you want them to see. Click **Edit** on your view to see its details and configure orbit limits using the sliders in the scene view. 

- Limit how far users can pan up/down or side to side
- Use the **Lock** icon to test movement boundaries
- Move the camera while **Unlocked** to adjust its position, focus point, and zoom
- If you don't set orbit limits, users orbits will be unrestricted.

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '42%', height: 0, overflow: 'hidden', maxWidth: '80%', width: '80%', margin: '2rem auto', borderRadius: '10px', boxShadow: '0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)' }}>
  <video 
    style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%', borderRadius: '10px' }}
    controls
    muted
    playsInline
  >
    <source src="/Edit-orbit-limits.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
</div>

Saving updates the view's position, look-at target, and zoom. Reset returns to the last saved state.

### Zoom

Each view can have its own zoom:

- You can change zoom by using ctrl+scroll, or manually adjusting the zoom field
- Lower values (e.g. 0.8) are wide, higher values are tighter
- Zoom works like focal length in cameras - lower values create wide-angle effects with perspective distortion, while higher values give telephoto compression.

Adjusting Zoom between views can create more interesting camera transitions and animations. 

## 5. Preview and Share

Once your views are set:

- Click **Save & Preview** to test your scene as a viewer would see it 
- Use the **Share** button to generate a link, scenes need to be published before sharing.
- Shared scenes respect the views and limits you define
- Published scenes are not shared anywhere automatically by Reflct.
