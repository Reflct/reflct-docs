## 1. Create Your First Scene

- Log in to Reflct
- On the dashboard, click **New Scene**
- Give your scene a name and tags
- Drag and drop your `.ply` or SOGs bundle into the uploader

### Optimization

If you upload a `.ply`, you can choose to optimise the file. This converts it to a compressed `.ply` format, which is highly optimized at roughly 5-7x smaller than the original `.ply`. The process significantly reduces file size while preserving high visual quality. SOGs provides even greater compression at up to 20x, check our guide on how to convert to SOGs.

## 2. Adjust the Scene Orientation

After your scene loads, it's likely that you'll need to adjust the orientation:

- Click **Edit Scene** in the top left
- Enable the grid to see the horizon
- Use the gizmos to rotate and align your scene correctly

**Tip:** Most scenes will need a small rotation fix to align to the horizon.

## 3. Navigate the Scene

- **WASD** – Move through the scene
- **Click** – Set orbit focus point
- **Right-click / two-finger drag** – Free camera look
- **Scroll** – Dolly in/out

## 4. Set Up Views

Views let you define camera angles and control how users explore your scene.

- Go to the **Views** panel
- Create a **View Group**, then add a **View**
- Move the camera to a good angle, then click **Save**

### Setting Orbit Limits

Orbit limits are a key feature of Reflct, and ensure that your users only see what you want them to see. Click **Edit** on your view to see its details and configure orbit limits:

- Limit how far users can pan up/down or side to side
- Use the **Lock** icon to test movement boundaries
- Move the camera while **Unlocked** to adjust its position, focus point, and zoom

Saving updates the view's position and look-at target. Reset returns to the last saved state.

### Zoom

Each view can have its own zoom:

- Lower values (e.g. 0.8) are wide, higher values are tighter
- Zoom works like focal length in cameras - lower values create wide-angle effects with perspective distortion, while higher values give telephoto compression.

Adjusting Zoom between views can create more interesting camera transitions and animations. 

## 5. Preview and Share

Once your views are set:

- Click **Save & Preview** to test your scene as a viewer would see it
- Use the **Share Scene** button to generate a link
- Shared scenes respect the views and limits you define
