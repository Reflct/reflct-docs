# Linking Scenes

Linking scenes allows you to connect multiple scenes within the same viewer component, allowing users to navigate between them. This is particularly useful in scenarios like real estate, where visitors can move between different rooms or from interior to exterior views.

To link scenes:
- Open the 'Metadata' view
- Under the 'Linked scenes' dropdown menu, select the scene you want to link to
- Important: Links must be bidirectionalâ€”ensure you also add the reverse link in the target scene
- Use the 'Linked scene label' field to customize how each scene appears in the viewer's scene selection dropdown

Once linked, users will see a dropdown menu in the viewer that allows them to switch between connected scenes.
